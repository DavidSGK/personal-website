const bio = `
Hi! I'm currently an undergraduate student at the University of Waterloo in my 1B term of Software Engineering. If I'm not grinding out assignments or looking for something new to learn, you can often find me immersed in creative work - I love digital media production and music, singing in particular. Right now, I'm a jack of all trades, master of none, but I'm always working to change that status.
